        <h2>OVERVIEWING THE MISSION </h2>
        <pre style="font-size:large;"> 
    Chandrayaan-3 , 
    India's third lunar exploration endeavor, represents the culmination of years of scientific innovation, engineering excellence, and unyielding determination. Following in the footsteps of 
    its predecessors, Chandrayaan-1 and Chandrayaan-2, this mission is a testament to India's growing prowess in space exploration.
    The mission’s primary objective is to achieve a soft landing on the lunar surface, a feat that places India among a select group of nations. With no orbiter component, Chandrayaan-3 focuses
    entirely on delivering a lander and a rover to the Moon's unexplored south pole—a region shrouded in mystery and scientific promise. At the heart of Chandrayaan-3 lies its lander, a robust 
    and meticulously designed craft equipped with advanced sensors and technology to ensure a precise and safe descent onto the lunar surface. The rover, a marvel of engineering, is programmed 
    to traverse the rugged lunar terrain, conducting experiments and sending invaluable data back to Earth.
           
    This mission is more than just a scientific endeavor; it is a symbol of human curiosity and the relentless pursuit of knowledge. 
    Chandrayaan-3 seeks to expand our understanding of the Moon’s geology , mineralogy, and its environment—insights that could be pivotal for future lunar exploration and even habitation. <br>
    The south pole of the Moon, with its permanently shadowed craters and potential water ice deposits, is a treasure trove of information. Chandrayaan-3’s exploration of this area could unlock
    secrets about the early solar system, the formation of celestial bodies, and perhaps even the origins of life itself. 
    Chandrayaan-3 has been launched at 2:35 P.M. from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh carries by ISRO’s largest and most powerful rocket, the Launch Vehicle Mark III. <br>
       
 <b> INTERESTING FACTS ABOUT THE CHANDRAYAAN-3 : </b>
             <ol>
             <li>Chandrayaan-3 is a follow-on mission to Chandrayaan-2 which aims at soft landing at Moon’s south pole.It consists of a lander and a Rover which has been launched into the space by a rocket called 
LVM3 from SDSC SHAR, Sriharikota. While the Chandrayaan-2 which was launched in 2019 consisted of an orbiter, a Lander and a Rover, because of a software glitch the craft lost all communications 
just minutes before it was supposed to land and later it was crashed. Though it was not a complete failure, the orbiter is still functional and provides valuable data to the organization. </li>
             <li>The launcher used to support the moon lander Vikram is GSLV (Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle) also known as Launch Vehicle Mark III. The height of this launcher is about 5 metres.</li>
            <li>The spacecraft is expected to touch down on the moon on 23 August after a voyage that will last more than 40 days. The craft is set to land on the Moon’s South Pole, where Chandrayaan-1 
discovered the molecules of water and shocked the world by its major success. </li> 
            <li>ISRO has done some modifications to make it reliable than its predecessor. Chandrayaan-3 consists of a Lander Vikram, which is named after Vikram Sarabhai, the Rover Pragyan and a propulsion module.
The weight of the Vikram Lander has been increased by 280kg from its previous version and it also carries more fuel to stay on it’s intended path to the Moon’s surface. </li>
            <li>The craft collectively weighs 3,900 kg in which the weight of the propulsion is 2148 kg and the weight of lander and Rover together is 1752 kg. 
This total weight is close to the maximum capacity of the GSLV MK III which is India’s strongest rocket. </li>
             <li>Chandrayaan-3 has three phases : 
1.The Earth-Centric Phase 
2.The Lunar-Transfer Phase 
3.The Moon-Centric Phase
The Earth Centric Phase involves the pre-launch phase and the Earth bound manoeuvre phase which will help the spacecraft to change its directions.The Lunar-Transfer Phase involves the 
transfer trajectory phase which will help it to choose the path that will lead it towards the lunar orbit.   
The Moon-Centric Phase involves all steps from lunar orbit insertion to landing. 
             </li>
             <li>As Chandrayaan-3 safely lands on the moon, the Pragyan Rover will be deployed to explore. The Rover will be released from Lander using a ramp. This six-wheeled rover 
used in spacecraft is powered by solar energy and carries two spectrometers to study the composition of the moon’s surface. It will move around the landing area for 
about 14 Earth Days which is equivalent to one lunar day. </li>
            <li>Vikram Lander used in Chandrayaan-3 is equipped with four scientific instruments. The first one is seismometer designed to detect moonquakes, the second one studies how heat moves
through the lunar surface, the third aims at understanding the plasma environment around the moon and the fourth one is retro-reflector which helps to understand the gravitational
interaction between the moon and the planets.</li>
            <li>The lander will touch down on the moon’s surface with a horizontal velocity of less than 5 metre per second, a vertical velocity of less than two metre per second and a slope less than 120 degrees. </li>
            <li>To date only three countries have successfully achieved lunar landings : 
1.The United States 
2.The Former Soviet Union 
3.China. 
India aiming to be the fourth country to safe landing on the surface and first nation in the world to land on the Moon’s South Pole. </li>
